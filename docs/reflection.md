* indexing takes O(n) since LinkedList only has pointers to the head and tail. I had an idea of giving each node an index, but that would increase insertion and removal's time complexity from O(1) to O(n).

* as I coded, I found many holes in my specs. To cover the whole class, the spec would be so long.
