# adT-utiliT

adT-utiliT is a Ruby gem that provides a range of useful data type classes such as Linked List, Queue, Stack, StackQueue, and Polytree. Most common and intuitive methods are available for each class.


## Get Started
after installing the gem, require necessary library in your file.

```ruby
require 'linked_list'
require 'stack'

```
## Test-Driven Development
I employed TDD approach in creating adT-utilT gem and wrote a thorough spec for each class before implementation. This ensured the efficiency of the development and resulted in robust code. All Rspec files used are available in the 'development' branch.
