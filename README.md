# AdtUtilit (in development)

AdtUtilit is a Ruby gem that provides a range of useful data type classes such as Linked List, Queue, Stack, StackQueue, and Polytree. Most common and intuitive methods are available for each class. See documentations for the details. [Link to RubyGems][ruby_gems_link]

## Get Started
after installing the gem(type 'gem install adt_utilit' in the terminal), require necessary library in your file.

```ruby
require 'linked_list'
require 'stack'

```

## Test-Driven Development
I employed TDD approach in developing AdtUtilit, created a thorough spec using RSpec before writing any code, and conducted unit testing for each class. This ensured the efficiency of the development and resulted in robust and clean code.
