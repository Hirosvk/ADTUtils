# AdtUtiliT

AdtUtiliT is a Ruby gem that provides a range of useful data type classes such as Linked List, Queue, Stack, StackQueue, and Polytree. Most common and intuitive methods are available for each class. See documentations for the details.

## Get Started
after installing the gem(type 'gem install adt_utilit' in the terminal), require necessary library in your file.

```ruby
require 'linked_list'
require 'stack'

```

## Test-Driven Development
I employed TDD approach in creating AdtUtiliT gem and created a thorough spec for each class before writing any code. This ensured the efficiency of the development and resulted in robust code.
